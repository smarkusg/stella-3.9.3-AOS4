/**
  Cartridge class used for SpectraVideo CompuMate bankswitched games.

  This is more than just a cartridge mapper - it's also a "computer" add-on.  
  There's two 8K EPROMs soldered on top of each other.  There's two short
  wires with DB-9's on them which you plug into the two controller ports.
  A 42 or so key membrane keyboard with audio in and audio out, and 2K of RAM.

  There are 4 4K banks selectable at $1000 - $1FFF, and 2K RAM at
  $1800 - $1FFF (R/W 'line' is available at SWCHA D5, so there's no separate
  read and write ports).

  Bankswitching is done though the controller ports
    SWCHA: D7 = Audio input from tape player
           D6 = Audio out to tape player and 4017 CLK
                1 -> increase key column (0 to 9)
           D5 = 4017 RST, and RAM direction. (high = write, low = read)
                1 -> reset key column to 0 (if D4 = 0)
                0 -> enable RAM writing (if D4 = 1)
           D4 = RAM enable: 1 = disable RAM, 0 = enable RAM
           D3 = keyboard row 3 input (0 = key pressed)
           D2 = keyboard row 1 input (0 = key pressed)
           D1 = bank select high bit
           D0 = bank select low bit

    INPT0: D7 = FUNC key input (0 on startup / 1 = key pressed)
    INPT1: D7 = always HIGH input (pulled high thru 20K resistor)
    INPT2: D7 = always HIGH input (pulled high thru 20K resistor)
    INPT3: D7 = SHIFT key input (0 on startup / 1 = key pressed)
    INPT4: D7 = keyboard row 0 input (0 = key pressed)
    INPT5: D7 = keyboard row 2 input (0 = key pressed)

  The keyboard's composed of a 4017 1 of 10 counter, driving the 10 columns of
  the keyboard.  It has 4 rows.  The 4 row outputs are buffered by inverters.

  Bit 5 of portA controls the reset line on the 4017.  Pulling it high will reset
  scanning to column 0.  Pulling it low will allow the counter to be clocked.

  Bit 6 of portA clocks the 4017.  Each rising edge advances the column one
  count.

  There's 10 columns labelled 0-9, and 4 rows, labelled 0-3.

                           Column

    0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9

  Function and Shift are separate keys that are read by 2 of the paddle inputs.
  These two buttons pull the specific paddle input low when pressed.

  Because the inputs are inverted, a low indicates a pressed button, and a high 
  is an unpressed one.

  The audio input/output are designed to drive a tape player.  The audio output is 
  buffered through an inverter and 2 resistors and a capacitor to reduce the level
  to feed it into the tape player.

  The audio input is passed through a .1uf capacitor and is pulled to 1/2 supply
  by two 20K resistors, then it goes through a hex inverting schmitt trigger to
  square it up.  This then runs into bit 7 of portA.

  This code was heavily borrowed from z26.
